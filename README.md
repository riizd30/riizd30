## 🚀 About Me  
"As a dedicated Physics educator, I am committed to inspiring students through innovative teaching methods while embracing data analytics to enhance educational outcomes."

Hai, I am Muhammad Rizky, a recent Physics Education graduate of Indraprasta PGRI Jakarta University. Currently, I am working as Physics and Electronics educator in which I embed the wonders of science in the students. Additionally, I also perform the task of a social media specialist where I put my creativity and communications into work to engage our community in my work at school.

Big Data has also stirred my interest with an intense passion for continuous learning in data analytics and data science through attending several online trainings, courses, and boot camps. Grounded in physics education, I have applied the core principles related to data analytics. My skill set has evolved through teaching, physics, IoT robotics, and my creative mind, coupled with diligence and strong communication skills. I enjoy teamwork and creativity, looking for constant chances to learn and develop my skills, adding new ideas into my future career.
